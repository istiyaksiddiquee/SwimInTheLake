# Swim in the Lake

This is a demo project that implements a personal data lake for a machine learning project. Goal of this project is to implement machine learning algorithm via Spark on Data Lake (in this case MinIO), where everything is powered by Kubernetes. 

Technologies that will be used here are: 
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Helm
* Spark (PySpark)
* MinIO
* Apache Airflow
